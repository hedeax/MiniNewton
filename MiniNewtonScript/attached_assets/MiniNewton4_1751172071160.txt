🎬 Project Brief: Simplified Newton Alternative in After Effects
Codename: MiniNewton

🧠 Goal
Create a lightweight, script-based alternative to the After Effects plugin Newton, focused on replicating key 2D physics behaviors such as gravity, bounce, and basic joints — all within the constraints of native scripting (ExtendScript / ScriptUI). No third-party plugins or native C++ required.

🛠️ Tools & Environment
Component        | Technology
----------------|------------
Scripting Language | Adobe ExtendScript (.jsx)
UI Framework    | ScriptUI (for dockable After Effects panels)
Host Application| Adobe After Effects (2021 and newer recommended)
Target Layers   | 2D shape layers, solids, or precomps

📦 Phase Breakdown

✅ Phase 1: Core Physics Engine
A script that applies basic rigid-body-style physics to layers using simplified logic.

Features:
- Apply gravity (constant downward force)
- Simulate velocity and acceleration
- Detect collision with a floor plane (e.g., Y = 900)
- Apply bounce (elasticity) on collision
- Bake position keyframes to layers

Script Inputs:
- Gravity strength (slider)
- Bounce elasticity (slider)
- Floor Y-position (number input)
- Simulation duration (seconds or frames)
- Button: Run Simulation

🔄 Phase 2: Joints and Constraints (Optional / Future)
Extend physics to handle chained or connected objects.

Planned Features:
- Pivot Joints: Simulate pendulum behavior
- Distance Joints: Maintain a constant distance between layers
- Pseudo-spring motion (non-accurate but visually similar)
- Connect layers and simulate dependent movement

🔁 Phase 3: Triggering and Interactions
Simulate interactions like:
- Triggering events on collision
- Physics only starts after a delay or user action

🎨 UI Design
The UI will be created using ScriptUI and include:

UI Element       | Function
----------------|----------
Gravity (Slider) | Strength of gravitational pull
Bounce (Slider)  | Elasticity coefficient (0 = no bounce, 1 = perfect)
Floor Position (Input) | Y-axis value where objects collide
Simulation Length | In seconds or frames
Run Simulation (Button) | Starts the frame-by-frame simulation and keyframe baking

UI will be dockable like any standard After Effects panel.

✍️ Development Strategy
We will:
1. Write ExtendScript that runs a frame-by-frame simulation loop.
2. Store each frame’s position and velocity in an array.
3. On completion, apply baked position keyframes to the layer(s).
4. Wrap this in a user-friendly ScriptUI panel for reusability.
5. Modularize the script to allow future expansion (e.g., collisions, chains).

🚧 Limitations (Known & Accepted)
- No real-time simulation preview (Newton has its own physics viewer — not possible in ScriptUI)
- No inter-object collision (unless faked with bounding box math)
- No 3D physics
- All simulations are pre-baked — not dynamic or interactive post-run

🔄 Continuation Instructions
To continue the project on a logged-in account:
1. Copy or upload this brief into a new conversation.
2. Say: “Let’s continue the MiniNewton After Effects scripting project — I’ve pasted the brief.”
3. I will resume by:
   - Writing the first prototype script
   - Walking you through the logic
   - Iterating on the system step-by-step

💬 Example Prompt to Continue Later
Let’s continue the MiniNewton After Effects scripting project — I’ve uploaded the brief.
Start with Phase 1: simulate gravity and bounce and bake keyframes.
